# Bomberman Remake (Local Multiplayer)


## Introduction

Bomberman is a classic arcade-style game where players control their characters (the "bombermen") who must navigate through a maze-like environment, placing bombs to destroy obstacles and collect power-ups. The goal of the game is to be the last player standing.

## Gameplay

The game supports up to 4 players. Each player controls their bomberman using the following keys:

Player 1:

-   Movement: **WASD**
-   Bomb: **Left Shift**

Player 2:

-   Movement: **TFGH**
-   Bomb: **Space**

Player 3:

-   Movement: **IJKL**
-   Bomb: **Left Alt**

Player 4:

-   Movement: **Arrow Keys**
-   Bomb: **Right Shift**

The players can place bombs by using their corresponding bomb key. The bombs will explode after a short period of time, destroying any obstacles within the blast radius. The players can also pick up power-ups, such as extra bombs or increased blast radius, to help them progress through the level.

The players only have **1 life**, and will lose it if they are caught in the blast of their own bomb. The game is over when all but one player runs out of lives.

## Power-ups

There are several types of power-ups that the players can collect to help them progress through the level:

-   **Extra bombs**: Allows the players to place more bombs at once.
-   **Increased blast radius**: Increases the size of the bomb's blast radius.
-   **Speed boost**: Increases the player's speed.
