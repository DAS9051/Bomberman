# Bomberman Remake (Local Multiplayer) 


## Introduction

Bomberman is a classic arcade-style game where players control their characters (the "bombermen") who must navigate through a maze-like environment, placing bombs to destroy obstacles and enemies. The goal of the game is to be the last player standing while avoiding or defeating enemies and collecting power-ups.

## Gameplay

The game supports up to 4 players. Each player controls their bomberman using the following keys:

Player 1:

-   Movement: **WASD**
-   Bomb: **Left Shift**

Player 2:

-   Movement: **TFGH**
-   Bomb: **Space**

Player 3:

-   Movement: **IJKL**
-   Bomb: **Left Alt**

Player 4:

-   Movement: **Arrow Keys**
-   Bomb: **Right Shift**

The players can place bombs by using their corresponding bomb key. The bombs will explode after a short period of time, destroying any obstacles or enemies within the blast radius. The players can also pick up power-ups, such as extra bombs or increased blast radius, to help them progress through the level.

The players have one lives, and will lose one if they are caught in the blast of their own bomb or if they are hit by an enemy. The game is over when all but one player runs out of lives.

## Power-ups

There are several types of power-ups that the players can collect to help them progress through the level:

-   **Extra bombs**: Allows the players to place more bombs at once.
-   **Increased blast radius**: Increases the size of the bomb's blast radius.
-   **Speed boost**: Increases the player's speed.

## Conclusion

Bomberman Remake (Local Multiplayer) is a fun and challenging game that requires strategy and quick reflexes. With power-ups, the game offers a lot of replay value and will keep players entertained for hours. Players can compete with each other in the same screen and it will increase the excitement and engagement.
